## 🏠 Project 1: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

### 📌 Description
Predicts house prices using a **linear regression model** based on features like area and number of rooms.

### ⚙️ Libraries Used
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 🌸 Project 2: Iris Flower Classification

### 📌 Description
Classifies the species of Iris flowers using a **K-Nearest Neighbors classifier** based on petal and sepal dimensions.

### 📊 Dataset
Standard **Iris dataset** with:
- `sepal length`, `sepal width`, `petal length`, `petal width`
- `species` (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

### ⚙️ Libraries Used
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your system.
2. Open each `.ipynb` notebook file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run the code cells one by one.
4. Make sure the respective `.csv` dataset is in the same folder as the notebook.
